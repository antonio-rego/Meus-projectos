    <h4>My Projects</h4>
    <p class="projects-intro">Here is a small sample of a few projects I have built from scratch for practice. </br>
      I have created many more, but I decided to include these because I made them entirely on my own, and I believe they represent well what I am capable of.</p>

      <h4>About Me</h4>
      <div>My name is António, and I am a 22-year-old Portuguese man. I actually graduated in Sports Science, even finishing with the second highest grade average in my year.<br>However, I got interested in programming and decided to learn how to code, which I really enjoyed. I started by learning the web stack (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and later explored frameworks like React.<br>I also have experience with Git and GitHub, as well as using tools such as Vite. <br>Currently, I am learning about data fetching and continuously improving my skills.
